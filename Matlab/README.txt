Matlab programs are organized in modules (+ML, +NT, +Routines) and folders (MMAP, View, Compute, Utils, misc_functions)


+ML 		contains Mlab dependencies for image processing
+NT 		contains a custom focus and parameters parse
+Routines 	contains Config

MMAP 	contains functions and classes to deal with memory mapping
View 	contains functions to visualize data
Compute contains function to perform computations
Utils 	contains the main script and functions to manage data
misc_functions are miscellaneous functions
