# Neurotools

Neurotools is a building block for several programs in the lab, as 'lightsheet' and analysis program 'easyRLS'. It provides tools to create and read parameters files and shortcuts for folder organisation. The +ML folder contains some Mlab dependencies, and all the Neurotools are accessible in the +NT folder.
