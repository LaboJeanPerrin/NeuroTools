# Mini doc to use easyRLS

## Install Matlab programs

First, you can clone the code by doing 

    git clone https://github.com/LaboJeanPerrin/NeuroTools.git

it will create a folder 'Neurotools' in the current directory. Then, because easyRLS is not the master branch yet, go in the Neurotools directory (`cd Neurotools`) and switch to the 'easyRLS' branch :

    git checkout easyRLS

Once you have the right code, open the `script.m` in 'Matlab/Utils'. In Matlab, do "add with subfolders" for the 'Neurotools/Matlab' folder.

## Run the code section after section

The benchmarks have been performed on 'Dream' for the run 2018-01-11/Run 05 on the layers 3 to 12.

### Set working directory

Replace the `cd` command argument by your project's folder containing the 'Data' directory. The architecture of 'Data' has to be 'Data/yyyy-mm-dd/Run xx/'.

The 'get focus' section loads the parameters and create a config file.

### Create binary from tif (448 s)

`tifToMmap` creates a 'raw.bin' binary file directly from the tif images. This file can be accessed with memory mapping in matlab thanks to the class `Mmap` and the info in the 'raw.mat' file. It can also be accessed from imageJ with the bioformats plugin by writing the appropriate NRRD header.

`stackViewer` allows to view the binary stack in a matlab figure with gui control thanks to memory mapping (like virtual stack in imageJ).

### Correct drift 

`driftCompute` **(92 s)** computes the drift on the projection of the reference layers relatively to the reference layer at the given reference index.

`seeDriftCorrection` plays a movie of the drift corrected brain by computing the translation online. You can then run `driftApply` **(175 s)** to create corrected binary stack if you are satisfied with the correction. `stackViewer` allows you to view the drift corrected hyperstack.

To view the stack in imageJ, you can create a NRRD header like the following in the same folder as the vinary stack.

    NRRD0001
    # Complete NRRD file format specification at:
    # http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html
    type: uint16
    dimension: 4
    sizes: 1018 634 10 1500
    endian: little
    encoding: raw
    data file: ./corrected.bin

You can then drag and drop the text file to imageJ, and the bioformats plugin will create a virtual stack.

### Select the ROI for dff computation

To avoid computing the dff on useless regions (i.e. background), you can select the ROI. It will be recorded in a 'mask.mat' matlab logical matrix. `maskViewer` will let you see the contour overlay on the stack.

#### Manually

`selectROI` will prompt each layer and let you draw a polygon whose inside defines the ROI.

#### Automatically

You can use a reference stack which already has a mask and use this mask after a registration. (Now only layer by layer using 2D imregdemons, but only a few seconds).

### Computing baseline (2313 s)

To compute baseline, we use the '[runquantile](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caTools/versions/1.17.1/topics/runquantile)' function of '[caTools](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caTools/versions/1.17.1)', a R plugin coded in C.

To use it with matlab, you only have to run `loadlibrary` with the path of the `.so` and the `.h`. They are in 'Neurotools/Tools', an example is given in the script.

Then you can run `caToolsRunquantile` which reads the signal in the 'corrected.bin' file and creates a folder 'baseline' in the 'IP' folder. In this folder, there will be a `.bin` and a `.mat` file by layer.

/!\ THIS IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO DO

Example of time taken from layer 3 to layer 12. The time depends on the number of pixels in ROI.

### Computing DFF (647 s)

The formula for the dff computation is the following :

$$ \frac{\Delta f}{f} = \frac{\text{Signal} - \text{Baseline}}{\text{Baseline} - \text{Background}}$$

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%7Ef%7D%7Bf%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BSignal%7D-%5Ctext%7BBaseline%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BBaseline%7D-%5Ctext%7BBackground%7D%7D)

It is quite fast to compute with `dff` matlab function.
